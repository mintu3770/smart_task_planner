# üéØ Smart Task Planner

A Python-based application that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to break down high-level user goals into actionable, dependent tasks with estimated timelines. The frontend is built with Streamlit, and all generated plans are stored in a Supabase database for easy retrieval and management.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Reasoning:** Leverages Google's Gemini models (including Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro) to understand goals and generate logical task breakdowns.
- **Multiple Model Options:** Choose from four different Gemini models based on your needs (speed vs capability).
- **Task Dependencies:** Automatically identifies which tasks must be completed before others can begin.
- **Timeline Estimation:** Provides an estimated duration in days for each task.
- **Database Integration:** All generated plans are automatically saved to Supabase for future reference.
- **Plan History:** Browse, search, and manage your previously generated plans.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find past plans by searching goal keywords.
- **Interactive Frontend:** A clean and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit to input goals and view generated plans.
- **Structured Output:** The LLM is prompted to return clean JSON objects, ensuring reliable parsing and display.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend Logic:** Python
- **AI Models:** Google Gemini (2.0 Flash, 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Pro)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **API Interaction:** `google-generativeai` library
- **Database Client:** `supabase-py`
- **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Google API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- A Supabase account and project (free tier available at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-task-planner.git
   cd smart-task-planner
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up Supabase:**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to the SQL Editor and run the following SQL to create the required table:
```sql
     CREATE TABLE task_plans (
         id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
         goal TEXT NOT NULL,
         model_used TEXT NOT NULL,
         plan_json JSONB NOT NULL,
         created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
     );

     CREATE INDEX idx_task_plans_created_at ON task_plans(created_at DESC);
```
   - Get your Project URL and anon/public key from Project Settings ‚Üí API

5. **Set up your environment variables:**
   - Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project directory
   - Add your API keys and Supabase credentials:
```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
     SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
     SUPABASE_KEY="your_anon_public_key_here"
```

6. **Run the application:**
```bash
   streamlit run app.py
```

7. **Open your browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` (or the URL shown in your terminal)

## üìñ Usage

### Generating a Plan

1. Navigate to the **"Generate Plan"** tab
2. Enter your high-level goal in the text input field
3. (Optional) Select a different AI model from the dropdown
4. Click **"Generate Plan"**
5. View your structured task breakdown with dependencies and timelines
6. The plan is automatically saved to your database

### Viewing History

1. Navigate to the **"Plan History"** tab
2. Browse your 20 most recent plans
3. Use the search bar to find specific plans by goal keywords
4. Click on any plan to expand and view full details
5. Delete unwanted plans using the delete button

## üîí Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API keys and Supabase credentials secure
- The Supabase `anon` key is safe for client-side use with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- For production use, consider implementing user authentication and RLS policies

## üö¢ Deployment

### Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub (excluding `.env`)
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Add your secrets in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
```toml
